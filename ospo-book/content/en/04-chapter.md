# Introduction

Understanding the day-to-day activities of those managing open source operations within an organization is crucial for several reasons. First and foremost, it sheds light on the fundamental tasks that an OSPO must focus on to ensure the organization's 
technology strategy and aefforts aligns with open source best practices. This knowledge helps to streamline engineering processes and maintain compliance with open source licenses and security measures.

OSPO day-to-day operations encompass a broad spectrum of activities aimed at enhancing open source engagement and compliance within the organization, including providing personalized technical support on licensing and software selection, leveraging automation tools for process efficiency and security, 
developing and disseminating educational materials, strategically allocating resources, managing risks through comprehensive assessments of the tech stack, sponsoring and engaging with open source communities and foundations, measuring technical debt in projects, and facilitating coordination 
across various organizational divisions to align both technical and non-technical objectives.

- **Personalized Technical Support:** Involves answering questions on all aspects of open source, including license compliance, selecting open source software, and interactions with vendors. It also includes engaging with the community and partners, securing sponsorships, and organizing open source events.
  
- **Automation tools:** Efficiency in process automation is key because policies alone may not always be effective as they are not always followed. Managers are usually seeking effective options for automation tooling,
including for security automation and reporting, such as the integration of scorecards.

- **Documentation, Training, and Education:** Crucial to ensure that individuals are qualified to assess projects. Developing training materials and documentation and aiding teams to produce these across different departments are key tasks.

- **Resource Allocation:** Requires a strategic approach to prioritize effectively.

- **Risk Management:** Involves assessing the risks the organization faces. Obtaining a comprehensive view of the organization's tech stack, such as generating SBOMs, and considering software from vendors, legacy software, and proprietary software is crucial. This is more about a business assessment perspective rather than just data gathering. Decisions need to be made on whether to optimize SBOMs or to allocate time to other areas.

- **Sponsoring Open Source Communities and Foundations:** Providing insights into the dynamics and complexities of open source governance and models is part of this.

- **Measuring Technical Debt:** In open source projects requires understanding maturity and governance models.

- **Coordinate with Various Parts of the Organization:** Map interactions with teams based on the OSPO flower diagram, distinguishing between technical questions (engineering) and non-technical questions (business, design team).


## Assessing Daily Operations

This section presents a detailed overview of the operational considerations necessary for managing open source initiatives within organizations. This section is structured to cover several key areas: the core reasons for Open Source Program Offices (OSPOs) to prioritize specific tasks, the tangible benefits these tasks 
provide to the organization, the scope of engagement with open source in terms of usage and contribution, and an inventory of tools and services that support these efforts.
