## AMER & EMEA Meeting Notes

- [oss-security] backdoor in upstream xz/liblzma (found when an unrelated project): https://lwn.net/ml/oss-security/20240329155126.kjjfduxw2yrlxgzm@awork3.anarazel.de/  
- Social engineering attack (gaining trust by the community and latter a social attack happens)
- OSPO need: Need to find a way to measure these kind of vulnerabilities / attacks
- CHAOSS is working on taking a retrospective look at the Data Science WG
- OSPO has procedures and policies. But there’s no real way to see this in advance, but pick up quickly
- Response quickly best practices: 
- SBOMs Compliance Ready
- Automation Security checks ready (e.g OpenSSF Security Scorecard)
- There is in many organizations a CERT (emergency response team) that is equipped with the ability to respond quickly. Perhaps one part of the impact is knowing to have these relationships already in place so that it’s easy to communicate internally the severity of a problem.
incident response teams
- Scorecard management up to date
- Know who can fix that particular bug and get the feedback loop well-automated
- Some OSPOs looking into changes of license (e.g Redis) - license terms are clear (role of the OSPO?) and indicate how explicit these licenses are
- If there is a way to rate software by it’s trust (e.g a project hosted under a foundation vs a project governed / maintained  by a singel vendor) 
- Almalinux foundation use case: the point of donating a project to a foundation to mitigate single vendor. 

Action Item: 

- Include these cases / situations as part of the Chapter 4 with best practicess to overcome these situations
